A simple drawing game with a slight twist. To see the scipt running, follow the link below:

The slight twist is that I applied an inverted easing method to the position of the cursor as it draws. I wanted it to have the effect of a paintbrush or fountain pen that pools up the slower it move across a page. However, my method of easing has the interesting side effect of exploding exponentially when you hold in one place.  
To change colors, click the little circles of colors.  
To clear the canvas, click the little 'x' in the corner.  
Enjoy.
